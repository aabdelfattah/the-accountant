```bash
createdb accountant
```

2. Update `.env` file with your database URL:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/accountant?schema=public"
```

3. Push the schema and seed:
```bash
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
```

4. Verify with Prisma Studio:
```bash
npm run db:studio
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Before starting a phase:**
   - Review the tasks
   - Estimate time
   - Plan file structure

2. **During development:**
   - Write code
   - Add TypeScript types
   - Add comments for complex logic

3. **After development (CRITICAL):**
   - Run `npm run build` - fix any errors
   - Run `npm run lint` - fix warnings
   - Write unit tests
   - Write integration tests if needed
   - Manual testing
   - Document any issues

4. **Before moving to next phase:**
   - All tests passing
   - No build errors
   - Update this plan.md with progress

---

## Notes

- The schema uses a unified `Expense` model for both COGS and operating expenses
- All transactions automatically generate journal entries
- Currency conversion tracked with gain/loss accounts
- System accounts cannot be deleted to maintain integrity
- Each phase includes dedicated testing time
- Build verification required before moving to next phase
